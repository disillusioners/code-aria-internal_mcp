# PostgreSQL Master Database Configuration
# Connection string for the master PostgreSQL database
# This database is used to store connection configurations in the mcp_connections table
# The master connection is automatically created with the name "master" on startup
# Format: postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname?sslmode=disable
#
# If POSTGRES_DB_DSN is not set or empty, the server will automatically fall back to
# an embedded SQLite database (mcp-postgres.db) in the current working directory.
# This is useful for local development and testing without requiring a PostgreSQL server.
#
POSTGRES_DB_DSN=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable

# Note: Additional database connections can be managed via the MCP tools:
# - create_connection: Add new connections
# - list_connections: View all configured connections
# - get_connection: Get connection details
# - update_connection: Update connection settings
# - delete_connection: Remove connections (master cannot be deleted)
#
# SQLite Fallback Mode:
# When POSTGRES_DB_DSN is empty, the server uses SQLite instead of PostgreSQL:
# - Database file: mcp-postgres.db (created in current directory)
# - No master connection is created (only applicable to PostgreSQL mode)
# - All connection management features work the same way
# - Use this for development, testing, or when PostgreSQL is not available
